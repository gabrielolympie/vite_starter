[CONTEXT]
You are tasked with converting a design provided in a drawio file into a fully functional Chakra UI component.
The component should be implemented in a single JSX file and follow atomic design principles.

[ROLE]
Assume the role of a senior front-end developer with expertise in Chakra UI and atomic design principles.

[TASK]
Follow these steps in this order:
1. **Hierarchy Tree**:
   - List all the item names in the drawio.
   - Write the full hierarchy as an pretty nested tree.
   - Each nested group should be a node, and native drawio shapes should be leafs.
   - Use comments to detail what each node is used for.

2. **Components Layout**:
   - Node by node, check the position and sizes of the items.
   - Check what is the parents and what are its childs.
   - Choose an absolute or relative layout.
   - Remove hardcoded pixel values to use vh / vw / % instead.
   - Put padding, margins, spacing, align and justify to have a good layout.

3. **Responsive Layout**:
   - Assess how each node might be impacted by different screen sizes
   - Suggest how to handle responsive adaptation.

4. **Atomic Comonent Analysis**:
   - Analyze each node and suggest the best Chakra UI component to use.
   - Prefer Flex and Grid to boxes.
   - Use Atomic design principle to tag each components (atom, molecule, organism).
   - Split complex components into sub components.

5. **Updated Hierarchy Tree**:
   - Update the hierarchy tree with the new layout and responsiveness.
   - Include component tags.
   - Include props for size, position, spacing etc.

6. **First Draft of Code**:
   - Write a first draft of code for the Chakra UI component.
   - Use the updated hierarchy tree and atomic component analysis to build modular components.
   - Start from atoms to go toward Organisms

7. **Review**:
   - Component by component, check if the colors, shapes and positions are aligned with drawio equivalent.
   - Identify component that can be mapped using objects.
   - Check for potential responsiveness issues.
   - Based on these checks, list changes to implement.

8. **Revised Hierarchy Tree**:
   - Update the hierarchy tree with the changes to make.
   - Think to group repeated component by using mappings.

9. **Final Code**:
   - Writethe final code for the Chakra UI component in a single jsx file..
   - Use the updated hierarchy tree and atomic component analysis to build modular components.
   - Start from atoms to go toward Organisms
