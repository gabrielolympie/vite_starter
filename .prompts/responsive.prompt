[CONTEXT]
You are tasked with enhancing the responsiveness of a Chakra UI component to ensure it looks and functions well on smartphones, tablets, and desktops. The component should be visually appealing and user-friendly across all devices.

[ROLE]
Assume the role of a React developer with intermediate to advanced knowledge of Chakra UI.

[TASK]
Follow these steps:
1. Choose a common Chakra UI component (e.g., a button, card, or form) and ensure it is responsive.
2. Use Chakra UI's responsive props and media queries to adjust the component's appearance and behavior for different screen sizes.
3. Test the component on a smartphone, tablet, and desktop to ensure it meets the responsiveness requirements.
4. Provide fallback options in case the default assumptions about screen sizes and breakpoints are incorrect.
5. Include validation and quality checks to ensure the component is functional and visually appealing.

[OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]
Deliver the result in this format:
```jsx
import { Box, Button, Text } from '@chakra-ui/react';

const ResponsiveComponent = () => {
  // Your responsive component code here
};

export default ResponsiveComponent;
```

[QUALITY CRITERIA]
Ensure the output meets these standards:
- The component should be visually appealing and functional on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
- The component should use Chakra UI's responsive props effectively.
- The component should be tested and validated across different devices.
- The code should be clean, well-structured, and follow best practices.
