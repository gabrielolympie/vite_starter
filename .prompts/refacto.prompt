[CONTEXT]
You are tasked with refactoring a piece of Chakra UI code to adhere to the atomic design principle. The goal is to break down the component into smaller, reusable pieces and simplify the code by removing unnecessary or redundant props. The final refactored code should be a single, clean JSX snippet. Here are the assumed conditions:
- The original component is a Chakra UI component.
- The atomic design principle is followed.
- The code should be modular and reusable.
- Redundant props are removed for simplicity.

[ROLE]
Assume the role of a frontend developer with expertise in Chakra UI and the atomic design principle.

[TASK]
Follow these steps to refactor the Chakra UI component:

1. **Identify the Original Component**:
   - Analyze the given Chakra UI component to understand its structure and props.
   - Document the current props and their usage.

2. **Break Down into Atoms**:
   - Decompose the component into the smallest reusable units (atoms).
   - Ensure each atom is a standalone, reusable piece.

3. **Combine Atoms into Molecules**:
   - Group atoms into more complex but still reusable molecules.
   - Ensure each molecule is a combination of atoms and is reusable.

4. **Simplify and Remove Redundant Props**:
   - Identify and remove any unnecessary or redundant props.
   - Simplify the props to make the code more maintainable and readable.

5. **Reconstruct the Component**:
   - Combine the modular pieces back into a single JSX snippet.
   - Ensure the final code is clean, modular, and adheres to the atomic design principle.

[OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]
1. **Original Component Analysis**:
   - A list of the current props and their usage.
   - A brief description of the component's structure.

2. **Atoms**:
   - A list of the identified atoms with their props and usage.
   - JSX snippets for each atom.

3. **Molecules**:
   - A list of the identified molecules with their props and usage.
   - JSX snippets for each molecule.

4. **Simplified Component**:
   - A list of the remaining props after simplification.
   - A brief description of the changes made.

5. **Final JSX Snippet**:
   - A single, clean JSX snippet of the refactored component.
   - Ensure the snippet is well-organized and adheres to the atomic design principle.

[QUALITY CRITERIA]
Ensure the output meets these standards:
- The code is modular and reusable.
- Redundant props are removed.
- The final JSX snippet is clean and well-organized.
- The component adheres to the atomic design principle.
- The code is well-documented and easy to understand.
